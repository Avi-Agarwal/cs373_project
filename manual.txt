RUNNING INSTRUCTIONS:

Python Version:
    Python 3.7

Required Libraries:
    numpy
    sklearn
    pandas
    matplotlib
    os
    collections

                            +----------------------------------+
                            |            METHOD 1              |
                            +----------------------------------+

Method 1 allows the user to choose the algorithm to run, as well as the number of k-folds.

Run method1.py

On running, Enron1 data will be preprocessed. (this may take a few seconds)

Then, you will be asked which algorithm to run. Enter 1 for KNN and 2 for SVM.

You can then select whether you want to plot accuracies, or if you want to run tests yourself.
(we recommend test)


                            +----------------------------------+
                            |            METHOD 2              |
                            +----------------------------------+

Method 2 Runs two algorithms for finding classifiers Naive Bayes and SVM. The test and training set are defaulted
to enron 4 and enron 3 but those can be changed by changing the global variables.
This method will train both methods and test the classifiers all together with one run. The console should tell the user
exactly whats going on and print a clear reading of the results at the end. For individual email testing a method is
provided called predict_single_email(email_path). This is currently commented out in the main function but can be used if
users want to manually test the classifiers using specific emails. (Main run takes a while)

To run: you can right click method2.py and hit Run 'main' or go to method2.py and scroll down to main and run it from there.

Run method2.py

On running, the models will be trained and a testing feature matrix is created which will take a couple minutes!
Overall running of main takes a couple minutes so if it appears stuck it probably isn't!
Sometimes a warning of non convergence appears and that is because our training set is pretty big so convergence is eventually
defaulted, but the overall results are still accurate!
