                            |            METHOD 1              |
                            +----------------------------------+

Method 1 allows the user to choose the algorithm to run, as well as the number of k-folds.

Simply run method1.py (python 3)

On running, Enron1 data will be preprocessed. (this may take a few seconds)

Then, you will be asked which algorithm to run. Enter 1 for KNN and 2 for SVM.

You can then select whether you want to plot accuracies, or if you want to run tests yourself.
(we recommend test)
